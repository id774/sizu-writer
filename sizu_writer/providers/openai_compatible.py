# sizu_writer/providers/openai_compatible.py: Chat Completions provider
#
#  Description:
#  This module speaks the OpenAI compatible Chat Completions API through
#  the openai package. The package is the client; it is not the choice
#  of an endpoint. Which service answers is decided by
#  GENERATION_BASE_URL alone, and that value is always passed to the
#  SDK, so the default URL compiled into the client can never be reached
#  by leaving a setting empty. Sakura AI Engine, OpenAI and any other
#  service speaking this protocol are the same case here.
#
#  One complete() call performs exactly one create() call. There is no
#  retry loop of our own and no second attempt with different
#  parameters: retries belong to the SDK, where GENERATION_MAX_RETRIES
#  bounds them, so that an operation costs a predictable number of
#  requests on a plan that counts them.
#
#  The answer is normalized into a CompletionResult and nothing else is
#  read from it. Metadata a compatible endpoint may omit — the usage
#  counts, the request id — is carried as it comes; only an answer with
#  no usable text, or one cut off by the output limit, is refused.

#  Requirements:
#  - Python Version: 3.9 or later
#  - openai
#
#  Version History:
#  v1.0 2026-08-05
#       Initial version, moved out of generator.py so that the transport
#       and the validation of a draft can change independently. Measure
#       one request and carry the elapsed seconds into the log, so that a
#       slow answer is visible before it becomes a timeout.
